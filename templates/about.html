            <h1>About HANSEL</h1>
            <p>
                HANSEL is the companion to GRETIL, walking the same path together.
            </p>
            <p>
                The goal of HANSEL is to continue the free and open exchange of academic-level Sanskrit e-texts.
                All items <strong>must</strong> clearly indicate their sources,
                and they also must eventually conform to basic structural requirements,
                but it's easy to get a project started.
                A <a href="/team">technical team</a> consisting of philologically and technically skilled scholars
                is ready to help you transform material and add it to the system.
                Whether you have brand-new material, upgraded versions of previous e-texts from GRETIL or SARIT,
                or even just high-quality image scans,
                simply get in touch by email.
            </p>

            <h3>Name and logo</h3>
            <p>
                "Human-accessible" means that material will always exist in forms
                that the greatest number of students and scholars can use directly,
                such as plain-text and HTML.
            </p>
            <p>
                "NLP-ready" means that the data will also be structured in anticipation of computational applications,
                for those with natural-language processing ideas they'd like to try out on as much data as possible.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <em>haṃsa</em> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamsa_(bird)">swan, or bar-headed goose</a>)
                symbolizes not only grace but also discernment (<em>viveka</em>).
                A world away, in the Grimms' tale, Hänsel and Gretel succeed against the odds by working together.
