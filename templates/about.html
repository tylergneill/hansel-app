            <h1>About HANSEL</h1>
            <p>
                HANSEL is a companion to GRETIL.
                Its goal is to continue the free and open exchange of academic-level Sanskrit e-texts,
                with a focus on diplomatic transcriptions of printed editions.
            </p>

            <h2>Name and logo</h2>
            <p>
                "Human-accessible" means that material will always exist in forms
                that the greatest number of students and scholars can use directly,
                such as plain-text and HTML.
            </p>
            <p>
                "NLP-ready" means that the data will also be structured in anticipation of computational applications.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <em>haṃsa</em> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamsa_(bird)">swan, or bar-headed goose</a>)
                symbolizes not only grace but also discernment (<em>viveka</em>).
                A world away, in the Grimms' tale, Hänsel and Gretel succeed against the odds by working together.
            </p>

            <h2>Principles</h2>

            <p>Keep submission as easy as sending an email, with material in whatever format.</p>
            <p>Make sure metadata always clearly indicates sources and contributions.</p>
            <p>
                Honor different goals by maintaining multiple versions of files,
                using a three-tier system to indicate progression toward an explicit data standard:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Tier I</strong>: Whichever initial version the contributor chooses
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Tier II</strong>: Passing automatic validation for HANSEL's structural data model
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Tier III</strong>: High-fidelity diplomatic correspondence to source edition
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                A <a href="/team">solo creator</a> working open-source is best to get things moving,
                and if the project works, control can be passed on to a rotating committee at a later date.
            </p>

            <h1>How It Works</h1>

            <p>
                HANSEL consists of two coordinated Git repositories:
                one for data and basic hosting with GitHub Pages,
                and one for the primary web app with extra features.
                Using Git takes care of fine-grained versioning.
                The public GitHub platform enables open-source access to everything,
                including PR-based change history.
            </p>

            <p>
                The web app is written in Python and Javascript
                and runs on a Digital Ocean server
                which holds an up-to-date clone of the data repo.
            </p>

            <p>Data is progressed through the system in the following manner:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    Users submit material by email.
                    agree to share it under the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license,
                    and communicate what remains to be done and how involved they'd like to be in processing.
                </li>
                <li>Metadata template is filled out.</li>
                <li>New text and metadata are uploaded and published on the site immediately.</li>
                <li>Work begins on a Tier II version.</li>
                <li>Tier II version and updated metadata are published.</li>
                <li>Time permitting, a Tier III version is also prepared and published.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>


            </p>

            <h2>Contribution</h2>
            <p>
                HANSEL's contribution system has three stages, with correspondingly different file formats:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Pre-Draft</strong> — any file format (<code>.doc</code>, <code>.pdf</code>, etc.), for email correspondence and preliminary local processing</li>
                <li><strong>Draft</strong> — plain-text (<code>.txt</code>, with <a href="txt_markup">custom markup</a>), for provisional display while progressing toward publication</li>
                <li><strong>Publication</strong> — XML (<code>.xml</code>, with <a href="xml_markup">minimal TEI markup</a>), for web display and scholarly citation</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Pre-Draft material is moved manually toward Draft format.
                Once the material passes a set of automated checks —
                run locally by <a href="team">technical team</a> members and also automatically on GitHub —
                it is suited for Draft presentation.
                Such mature Draft material (<code>.txt</code>)
                can then be automatically transformed into Publication material (<code>.xml</code>), and vice versa.
                This allows for continued improvement of material without the need to work in XML.
            </p>

            <h2>Presentation</h2>

            <p>
                The website you are reading dynamically serves both Draft and Publication material alike,
                with Drafts marked as such.
                Publication material is rendered by default on the website with <code>.html</code> transforms,
                but users can also opt for a <code>.txt</code> transform or the underlying <code>.xml</code>.
                Cumulative downloads, both of the entire collection, or of filtered search sets, are also always at the ready.
                The server also takes care of metadata search and basic transliteration.
            </p>
