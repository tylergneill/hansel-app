            <h1>About HANSEL</h1>
            <p>
                HANSEL is the companion to GRETIL, walking the same path, a step further on.
            </p>
            <p>
                Like numerous other legacy collections online,
                GRETIL is still useful in its frozen state,
                but since it no longer has support to grow,
                we need a new place to accommodate new Sanskrit e-text material.
                HANSEL aims to the next collaborative space for high-quality Sanskrit material online.
                It is designed to be open and easy for students and scholars to contribute to.
                Contributed material may be upgraded forms of e-texts from previous repositories like GRETIL or SARIT,
                or it may be entirely new.
                Contributors are supported by a <a href="/team">technical team</a>
                consisting of skilled scholars who share the burden of maintaining both data and code.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Human-accessible" means that material will always exist in forms
                that the greatest number of students and scholars can use directly,
                such as plain-text and HTML.
            </p>
            <p>
                "NLP-ready" means that the data will also be structured in anticipation of computational applications,
                for those with natural-language processing ideas they'd like to try out on as much data as possible.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to these two core values,
                HANSEL will also maintain a high standard of transparency,
                with clearly documented scholarly sources,
                open-source and versioned data and code,
                and easily searchable metadata.
            </p>
            <h3>Name and logo</h3>
            <p>
                The <em>haṃsa</em> (swan, or more accurately, bar-headed goose) symbolizes not only grace but also discernment (<em>viveka</em>).
                A world away, in the Grimms' tale, Hänsel and Gretel succeed against the odds by working together.
            </p>
